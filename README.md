# roa-ingredient-sender

This script will help you wire ingredients to other players by doing a few things
* Hides ingredients you have 0 of
* Adds inputs to enter the amount of each ingredient
* Adds max for individual and a max all button to quickly send all
* Auto populates the sending commands in chat and sends it*

Auto sending is split into chunks of 10 as that is the max the game supports

TODO:
* Figure out how to set up autofill for usernames
* Fix the layout as it is a bit fugly atm
* Find out if Vysn is gonna like this existing, may need to remove the auto send feature
